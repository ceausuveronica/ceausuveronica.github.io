The project contains the following files:
 
1.  IMAGINE.CPP` is the file Calculates and displays a histogram of a matrix set and displays an image
2.   2.JPG is the the picture file they use.
3.   pahar_vero_scad is an openscad application that displays multiple objects:
     a glass, 10 cylinders and a message
4.    senzor_temperatură.ino is an arduino application that contains a temperature sensor that displays the temperature
When we launch the application on our mobile phone, it will show us:

- On the top of the clock with the exact time
-  Below the bottom-right, left, right, and mobile phone's speed sensor
the radiation is subjected to the effect of a magnetic field in a perpendicular 
direction to their direction of motion, the alpha particles move in a sense, the beta into the other
sense, and the gamma particles remain in place. This clearly distinguishes three types
  radiation: alpha, beta, gamma. An atom can emit three types of radioactive radiation: alpha positive radiation,
  beta-negative radiation and electrically neutral gamma radiation

-  an image that disappears at the moment of touch
- at the bottom of the page a video is uploaded from the net from an address
The java file contains functions for the sensors used in the program
