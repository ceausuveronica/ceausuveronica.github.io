the radiation is subjected to the effect of a magnetic field in a perpendicular 
direction to their direction of motion, the alpha particles move in a sense, the beta into the other
sense, and the gamma particles remain in place. This clearly distinguishes three types

  beta-negative radiation and electrically neutral gamma radiation
